# Introduction and Setup

## Introduction

This is the first of four labs that are part of the Oracle Public Cloud Database Cloud Service workshop. These labs will introduce you to the Oracle Cloud and give you a basic understanding of the Oracle Database Cloud Service and many of the capabilities around data migration and administration.  

This lab will walk you through creating a virtual cloud network, a new Marketplace Developer Image, and a Database Cloud Service.  You will then connect into the Marketplace image using the ssh private key to perform steps to import data into DBCS.  **Note: You must be off your corporate VPN to do the labs.  It will also be helpful to have a notepad open as a holding place to copy and paste various items throughout all the labs.** 

***Your first step will be to create a compartment (container for all your services).  If this is a shared account/tenancy and others are running the workshop you need to assign a sequential number to each participant and label your compartment accordingly (Eg: workshop1...workshop2...workshop3...).  Also be mindful that different accounts have different service limits and you must stay within those limits.***

## Objectives

-	Familiarize yourself with the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.
-	Create a Virtual Cloud Network (VCN).
-	Create a Marketplace Developer Image.
-   Create an OCI DBCS Database.
-   Import data into DBCS.
-	Create an object storage bucket for zero down time backup files.

## Required Artifacts

-   The following lab requires a VNC Viewer to connect to an Image running on Oracle's IaaS Compute Service.

## Task 1:  Log into your Oracle Cloud Account, Review the Console, and Create a Workshop Compartment

- Go to [the Oracle Cloud Console](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/sign-in.html)

	![](images/1/002.png " ")

	![](images/1/003.png " ")

-	Upon initial login you are in the **Classic** services.  Navigate to the menu in the upper left and access and access the **Infrastructure** menu.  This will take you to the **OCI** services.   All the services used in this workshop are OCI Services.

	![](images/1/004.png " ")

- Note that the menu options have changed to show OCI native services (Gen 2 Cloud). Take note of the region.  

	![](images/1/008.png " ")

- Return to the menu in the upper left and select **Identity** and then **Compartments**.  

	![](images/1/009.png " ")

- Then select the root compartment.  Note that the menu options have changed to show OCI native services (Gen 2 Cloud).  

	![](images/1/005.png " ")

- Select **Create Compartment**.

	![](images/1/006.png " ")

- Enter your assigned participant number in the workshop name (eg: workshop1....or workshop2...etc.)

	![](images/1/007.png " ")

- **All the services you create henceoforth will be in your assigned compartment.**  Compartments are very useful for segregating content developed by different development teams and users.  They can be secured and assigned permissions appropriate to those using them.  If you expect to see services but don't see them check the compartment and region - they might be in different ones.  If you create a service in the wrong compartment you can either delete it or move it.  If it is in the wrong region you will need to delete and re-create the service.  In some cases different services that communicate with one another need to be co-located in a region.

## Task 2:  Create a Virtual Cloud Network (VCN)

- Return to the menu in the upper left and select **Networking** and then **Virtual Cloud Networks**.  

	![](images/1/010.png " ")

- Select **Start VCN Wizard**.  Select your workshop compartment.

	![](images/1/011.png " ")

- Select **Start VCN Wizard**.

	![](images/1/012.png " ")

- Enter the values noted below and then select **Next** and then **Create**.

	![](images/1/013.png " ")

	![](images/1/014.png " ")

- Select **View Virtual Cloud Network**.

	![](images/1/015.png " ")

- Open port 1521.  Note that in a production environment you would likely not open port 1521 but would use SSH tunnels.  To simplify the steps we will open the port.  Select the newly created vcn.

	![](images/1/045.png " ")

- Select the public subnet.

	![](images/1/046.png " ")

- Select the default security list.

	![](images/1/047.png " ")

- Add the following ingress rules.

	![](images/1/049.png " ")

	![](images/1/048.png " ")


## Task 3:  Create a Marketplace Developer Cloud Image

- Create a new ssh key pair.  Open a terminal window on your desktop and enter the following.  Name the key **id_rsa**.  Do not give it a passphrase.  Depending on whether you are on Linux, MAC, or Windows the output may be different.
```
<copy>ssh-keygen</copy>
```

	![](images/1/024.png " ")

- Navigate to **Compute - Instances**.

	![](images/1/016.png " ")

- Select **Create Instance**.

	![](images/1/017.png " ")

- Name your instance **workshop1_image** (specifying your participant number) and then select **Change Image Source**.

	![](images/1/018.png " ")

- Select **Oracle Images** and then **Oracle Cloud Marketplace Image**.

	![](images/1/019.png " ")

- Scroll to the bottom and select **Select Image**.

	![](images/1/020.png " ")

- Scroll down noting the defaults.  Be sure to select your public subnet, and to assign a public IP address.

	![](images/1/021.png " ")

- Be sure to increase your boot volume size to 150G, select the public ssh key you created above (publicKey.pub) and then select **Create**.  The image will get created in just a minute or two.

	![](images/1/022.png " ")

	![](images/1/023.png " ")
	
## Task 4:  Create Source and Target Database Cloud Service Instances

You will be creating two databases to support the following labs that migrate data from a source ('on-premise') database to a target database.  The first database will be called workshop1\_db.  This is the 'on-premise' source database.  After you initiate the creation of this database we will create a second database called workshop1\_db2.  This second database will be used at the target instance.

- Navigate to **Bare Metal, VM, and Exadata**.

	![](images/1/025.png " ")

- Select **Create DB System**.  

	![](images/1/026.png " ")

- Enter the following details and hit **Next**.

	![](images/1/027.png " ")

	![](images/1/028.png " ")

- Scroll down and select your **id_rsa.pub** file.

	![](images/1/029.png " ")

- Scroll down further, select your network, enter a hostname prefix, and then select **Next**.

	![](images/1/030.png " ")

- Enter the following details and then select **Create DB System**.

	![](images/1/031.png " ")

	![](images/1/032.png " ")

- Now perform these same steps again to create the target database.  The ONLY thing that is different will be the name in the console where you `Name your DB system` in the first screen (workshop1_db2).  Note on the second screen where you are prompted for `Database Name` (confusing, I know), you must also name this `orcl` for ZDM to work. 

## Task 5:  Import Data into DBCS source system `workshop1_db`.

- Navigate to Bare Metal, VM, and Exadata menu item.  We will be copying the data (dmp file) to DBCS and importing it into a new **alpha** user that we will create.  Note that we will use the pluggable database **pdb1** as the source database (simulates an on-premise database), and we'll be remote cloning `pdb1` in the source system to create a new **pdb1** pluggable database in the target system for the migration use cases in lab 3.

	![](images/1/033.png " ")

- Ensure you are in compartment **workshop1** (or other workshop/participant number), and in the correct region (the one you are using - this lab was developed in Phoenix region).

	![](images/1/034.png " ")

- Navigate to the node to retrieve the public IP address.

	![](images/1/035.png " ")

	![](images/1/036.png " ")

- Download the [oci\_ws\_alpha.dmp](https://objectstorage.us-ashburn-1.oraclecloud.com/n/natdcshjumpstartprod/b/dbcs/o/oci_ws_alpha.dmp) dump file and save it to a folder.  

- Open a command window in the workshop directory and scp the **oci\_ws\_alpha.dmp** file to dbcs.  Enter the following command.  Note in this case the file is in a 'data' directory:
```
<copy>scp -i keys/id_rsa data/oci_ws_alpha.dmp opc@&lt;DBCS IP&gt;:/tmp</copy>
```

![](images/1/037.png " ")

- SSH to dbcs.  Enter the following commands in a terminal window to log into the source database and change the permissions of the dmp file.
```
<copy>ssh -i keys/id_rsa opc@&lt;DBCS IP&gt; 
chmod a+r /tmp/oci_ws_alpha.dmp</copy>
```

- Sudo to oracle user.
```
<copy>sudo su - oracle</copy>
```

- Update the tnsnames file to add pdb1 and pdb2 pluggable databases.  We will be creating these in the following steps.  Enter the following:
```
<copy>vim /u01/app/oracle/product/19.0.0.0/dbhome_1/network/admin/tnsnames.ora</copy>
```

- Copy the container database entries in the tnsnames.ora file two times, and update as follows.  These entries provide connectivity to the pluggable databases.  As an aside, pdbs so NOT show on the cloud console.  If you forget the name you can query the v$pdbs system table.  Further, we have not yet created pdb2 - that will be done later in the workshop.  We are just adding the entry here now for use later.

	![](images/1/038.png " ")

- Log in with Sqlplus and create user **alpha**.
```
<copy>sqlplus system/&lt;password&gt;@pdb1;
create user alpha identified by &lt;password&gt;;
grant dba to alpha;</copy>
```

![](images/1/039.png " ")

- Change system parameter to allow the writing of log files to the O/S.  Connect as sys to change the parameter.
```
<copy>connect sys/&lt;password&gt; as sysdba;
show parameter filesystemio_options
alter system set filesystemio_options=asynch scope=spfile;
shutdown immediate;
startup;</copy>
```

![](images/1/040.png " ")

- Connect as user **alpha** and create an Oracle directory for the dmp file and then exit.
```
<copy>connect alpha/&lt;password&gt;@pdb1;
create directory tmp as '/tmp';
exit;</copy>
```

![](images/1/041.png " ")

- Import the data.
```
<copy>cd /tmp
impdp alpha/&lt;password&gt;@pdb1 directory=tmp dumpfile=oci_ws_alpha.dmp</copy>
```

![](images/1/042.png " ")

## Task 6:  Create an Object Storage Bucket to hold the zero down time backup files required in lab 2.

- Navigate to the menu in the upper left and select Object Storage.

![](images/1/043.png " ")

- Create bucket `zdm`.

![](images/1/044.png " ")

![](images/1/050.png " ")

***

This completes Lab 1.  You can proceed to Lab 2.
